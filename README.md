## My Contributions  
As a **Full Stack MERN Developer**, I played a key role in building **BudgetBuddy**, focusing on both backend and frontend to ensure seamless functionality. On the backend, I developed **secure APIs** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, integrated **MongoDB** for storing financial transactions, and implemented **JWT authentication** to ensure data privacy. Additionally, I structured **role-based access control** and optimized database queries for faster performance.  

On the frontend, I designed a **React-based interactive UI** using **Tailwind CSS**, making financial tracking intuitive and user-friendly. I implemented **Redux** for efficient state management and integrated **Chart.js** to visualize financial insights. Collaborating with my team, I enhanced **security measures, improved UX flow, and optimized API performance**, ensuring **BudgetBuddy** is a reliable and efficient finance management tool.
